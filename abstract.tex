\noindent This report describes a software development project completed by seven students in the IT2901 Informatics Project II course at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the spring of 2015.  The task was given by SINTEF, and it consisted of creating a mobile app which should recommend the user cultural heritage stories from the existing Digitalt fortalt platform. Stories from this platform are recommended to end users based on personalization techniques, which is about taking in context information and feedback from the users in order to make informed choices about what content to present. The report contains a thorough pre-study of other projects based on similar subjects. A full documentation of the development process from beginning to end, including all aspects such as project planning, product specification, implementation, testing, and customer relations can also be found in the report.
