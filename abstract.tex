This report describes a software development project completed by seven students in the IT2901 Informatics Project II course at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the spring of 2015. The problem to solve in this project was to develop an application that could give its users personalized story suggestions, based on their interests and with high concern for usability of the application. The application also had the requirement of being able to recommend stories based on what other users like, i.e. collaborative filtering.
The motivation for creating such an application was to increase the interest in cultural heritage, and to accomplish this by using innovative technologies to encourage its users to find and read stories that they would find interesting.

To create this application, it was necessary to spend time studying other applications already existing that had similar functionality to what we were trying to do. Much of the focus in the early stages were on refining the requirements with the customer, and planning out how the interface would look like. Several rounds of user testing and prototyping were done in order to detect problems and optimize the interface as much as possible.
 
The resulting application was able to give smart recommendations of stories based on interests and collaborative factors. It was able to present the stories to its users in an esthetically pleasing manner, as evaluated by the users and customer. It also contains functionality for giving feedback on stories, as well as functionality for saving and managing user-defined collections of stories. In conclusion, the application achieved what it was meant to do, which was to serve as a tool for testing whether this kind of personalization may lead to an increased interest in cultural heritage. The scope of the application was not massive, as it was mainly designed to be used by a controlled group of users for testing purposes. The team in charge of the application and this report feel that the application meets this goal both functionally and esthetically.
