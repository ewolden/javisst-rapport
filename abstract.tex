During this project a cross-platform application that provides personalized story 
recommendations was developed. These recommendations are developed by use of both 
content-based and collaborative filtering. In addition to accurate recommendations, 
an additional focus point was application usability. 
The developed application was named "Vettu hva?", and should hopefully 
encourage users to discover and read stories that they find interesting.\newline

The first stage of development was spent refining requirements with the 
customer and to do a study of applications with similar functionality. 
Both of these elements were used to plan what the user interface would look like. 
The presented user interface is the result of several rounds of user testing and 
prototyping done to achieve a streamlined experience. The application and all its 
development stages are presented. The tools and technologies used are described with 
justifications for the usage of them.\newline 

The resulting application is able to recommend stories to a user in an esthetically 
pleasing manner. In addition to recommending stories, users can create and manage 
bookmarks as they see fit, and rate stories after reading them. The application 
achieved what it was meant to do, which was to serve as a tool for evaluating 
personalization techniques as a method to increase interest in cultural heritage. 
As the application was developed for a research trial, some of the non-functional 
requirements were relaxed since personalization functions were the main focus. 
We feel that the application meets its intended goal both functionally and esthetically.\newline
