This report describes a software development project completed by seven students in the IT2901 Informatics Project II course at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), during the spring of 2015. The motivation behind this project was the assumption that personalization can lead to an increased interest in cultural heritage. The result of our work will be used to experiment with the personalization of cultural stories, to find out if this assumption holds true.\newline

We would like to thank our customer at SINTEF: Jacqueline Floch and Shanshan Jiang. They have been dedicated to, and enthusiastic about, the project and provided lots of useful feedback to the group throughout the development process. The feedback did not only concern the development of the product, but also different versions of the report. For this, we are grateful. In addition, we would like to thank our main supervisor, Soudabeh Khodambashi, and the fill-in supervisor Nina M. Smørsgård for feedback on various versions of the report. This helped the group to think critically on how to achieve the best possible report.
