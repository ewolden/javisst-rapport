\section{Status report example}
\label{app:status_report}

\todo{Tror ikke det er referert til status-rapportene noe sted i hoveddelen av rapporten}
Status report week 6\newline


		\textbf{Introduction} \newline
		This week has mostly been spent organising and making decisions that will impact the whole project.\newline
		
		\textbf{Progress summary} \newline
		The decisions that have been made will decide how the work is distributed in the coming weeks. Work has been made on defining goals and milestones. Furthermore, some of the tools to complete the given tasks have been found.\newline
		
		\textbf{Open / closed problems}\newline
		Closed problems:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A cross-platform framework have been chosen.
			\item A rough estimate of what needs doing, how long it will take and when it is due has been performed in the form of a product backlog.
			\item A list of functional requirements have been compiled after a discussion with the customer.
			Use case diagrams and scenarios have been made.
			\item Justification on some of the choices made so far have been written for the report:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Scrum
				\item Framework
			\end{itemize}
			\item Complete a WBS chart.
			\item A rules of engagement have been signed, this helps solidify what is expected of every member in the group.\newline
		\end{itemize}
		
		Open problems:\newline
		No specific ongoing problem at the end of this week.\newline
		
		Choosing a cross-platform framework was a difficult process for various reasons. There is not much experience in the group using such tools. Additionally there was an internal debate about what is expected from the customer and what does the team expect the end product to look like. This was discussed in light of the the constraints imposed from various aspects. However, the team members now feel confident that an appropriate tool have been chosen and are aware of some limitations this leads to.\newline
		
		Understanding properly what the customer wants and prioritizes has also been a focus this week. While this sounds easy enough, the technical details are often lost in communication. This is something that will require constant feedback and monitoring so that the project stays on track in regards to what is desired by the customer.\newline
		
		\textbf{Planned work for next period}\newline
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Familiarization with the chosen framework.
			\item Familiarization with digitaltfortalt.no API.
			\item Creating a design prototype is a goal, this will unify the group and make sure all members are working towards the same goal. Furthermore, this will explore what options there are and highlight any basic flaws in design.
